Arduino Port Expander Library

Written by Radu - Eosif Mihailescu <radu.mihailescu@linux360.ro> 2012-07-18

This library deals with expanding the I/O capabilities of the Arduino using
external devices such as shift registers, multiplexers and port expanders.

To the furthest extent that this is legally possible, the fork maintained by 
Radu - Eosif Mihailescu and published here https://github.com/csdexter/Arbitrator
is hereby released under the LGPL version 3.
To the furthest extent that this is legally enforceable, the copyright remains
with the authors listed above.

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

NOTES:
 * Pick the drivers you need (TEC_* classes) and instantiate as many as you
   need, depending on your topology
 * Construct the pin table (array of TExpanderEntry) and assign to Expanders.
 * Call digitalWriteEx(), digitalReadEx() and pinModeEx() just like you would
   with the non-Ex versions.

For general questions and updates on this library please contact the fork
maintainer at <radu.mihailescu@linux360.ro>.
